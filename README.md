# study-hours-prediction


In this project, we have two features 
(ie). Hours,Scores

Hours represents how many hours students can spend for studies

Scores represents how much scores they can secured

Here,we can use simple linear regression algorithm

LINEAR REGRESSION  : It refers the relation between independent and dependent variables

Dependent variable is nothing but our target variable

Independent variables is apart from the target variable

The task do to is what will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?
